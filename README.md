# Nate's Weather App
> Create a weather app using Json and API keys.
> Must have a search function (Search by City Name).
> Must display array of last 10 City searches, and store them to local storage.
> Must use openweathermap and get an API key from them.
> Must also query openweathermap's forecast parameter.
> Display a future 5 day forcast for current selected city.
> Include Tempurate, Humidity and Wind.
> Use icons from openweathermap.
> Live demo: [![Here](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/Here-blue?logo=link)](https://nweekley84.github.io/nates-weather-app/)

## General Information
- Create a weather app that shows not only current weather for user entered City, but also a 5 day future forcast.
- Purpose is to put into practice API useage for geocoding with [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api).
- Undertaken because I need experience using API keys and implimenting them.
